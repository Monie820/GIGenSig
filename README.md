# GIGenSig
Step 1:
Install related R package used in this study (See details in Install_R_packages.R)
Step 2:
Obtain TNBC sampls from public database (See details in TNBC_samples_prepare.R)
Step 3:
Idenfying genome instability related genes in TNBC (See details in GI_related_genes.R)
Step 4:
Genome instability-derived gene signature (GIGenSig) identification and survival analysis (See details GIGenSig_survival.R)
Step 5:
Explore mutation and FOXM1 expression patterns in three datasets(See details in Mutation_and_FOXM1exp.R)
Step 6:
Idenfying genome instability related genes in TNBC (See details in Validation.R)
Step 7:
Perform stratification analysis for clinical infromation in the METABRIC dataset (See details in Stratification_analysis.R)
Step 8:
Compare predictive performance of our GIGenSig with another three published signatures (See details in Prediction_compare.R)
